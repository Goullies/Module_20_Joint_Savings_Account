# Module_20_Joint_Savings_Account
## A Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses


### Background

The aim of this project was to automate the creation of joint savings accounts by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
